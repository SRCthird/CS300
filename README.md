# CS300: Analysis and Design

## Problem Statement

These projects aimed to efficiently manage and display course information, including prerequisites, as well as determine the most appropriate data structures.

## Approach

I utilized a `map` to store course data for quick lookup and a `struct` to encapsulate course details, focusing on efficient data handling.

## Challenges and Solutions

Parsing course data and managing prerequisite relationships were challenging; these were addressed through validation and systematic testing.

## Lessons Learned

This project improved my understanding of data structures and the importance of writing maintainable, readable code.

## Conclusion

The experience refined my approach to software design, emphasizing efficiency and code clarity.
